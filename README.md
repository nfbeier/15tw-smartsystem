# Overview

Github repository for hardware and software interfacing of the smart system used by the Hussein Ultrafast Plasma Science group at the University of Alberta for 15 TW laser experiments.

The smart system aims to interface a collection of hardware components necessary to perform high intensity laser-plasma interactions including FLIR Blackfly CCD, Newport XPS-D8 Motion Controller,
Agilent XGS-600 Vacuum Controller, Andor iKon-M Vacuum X-ray CCD, and more. The various equipment will be controlled using Python code, and be designed in a modular structure to allow for quick
changes in experimental setups.

# 15 TW Laser System

The Amplitude Arco X laser system is a 500 mJ, 30 fs at spec laser system firing at a repetition rate of 10 Hz. This laser system will be used by the Hussein Lab for relativistic
laser-driven plasma acceleration experiments.
